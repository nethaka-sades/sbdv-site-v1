                The Annual Prize Giving Ceremony of Bellanwila Sri Bodhiraja
                Dhamma School is a prestigious event dedicated to recognizing
                and celebrating studentsâ€™ academic and extracurricular

                their perseverance, discipline, and commitment to learning,
                motivating them to strive for even greater accomplishments in
                the future. The presence of esteemed monks, teachers, parents,
                and the school community makes this event even more special, as
                it reflects the collective efforts in nurturing well-rounded
                individuals.

                A key highlight of the ceremony is the House Championship
                Awards, which honor the houses that have demonstrated
                exceptional performance throughout the year. The house that
                secures the highest cumulative score across various competitions
                is awarded the Championship Trophy, while the First Runner-Up
                Award is presented to the house with the second-highest points.
                Additionally, a Special Recognition Award is granted to the
                house that has secured the most first-place victories in
                individual competitions. These awards not only promote healthy
                competition among students but also foster a sense of teamwork,
                leadership, and unity within the house system, making it a core
                aspect of student life at the Dhamma school.
